  for documentation.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-05-29

## [1.2.0] - 2022-03-18

### Added

  function that returns a last unread url for a topic list item. When multiple callbacks
  are registered, the first non-null value that is returned will be used.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-12-15

### Added

- Adds `addPosterIcons`, which allows users to add multiple icons to a poster. The
  addition of this function also makes the existing `addPosterIcon` now an alias to this
  function. Users may now just use `addPosterIcons` for both one or many icons. This
  function allows users to now return many icons depending on an `attrs`.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-11-25

### Removed

- Removes the `addComposerUploadProcessor` function, which is no longer used in
  favour of `addComposerUploadPreProcessor`. The former was used to add preprocessors
  for client side uploads via jQuery file uploader (described at
  https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options#file-processing-options).
  The new `addComposerUploadPreProcessor` adds preprocessors for client side
  uploads in the form of an Uppy plugin. See https://uppy.io/docs/writing-plugins/
  for the Uppy documentation, but other examples of preprocessors in core can be found
  in the UppyMediaOptimization and UppyChecksum classes. This has been done because
  of the overarching move towards Uppy in the Discourse codebase rather than
  jQuery fileupload, which will eventually be removed altogether as a broader effort
  to remove jQuery from the codebase.

### Changed

- Changes `addComposerUploadHandler`'s behaviour. Instead of being only usable
  for single files at a time, now multiple files are sent to the upload handler
  at once. These multiple files are sent based on the groups in which they are
  added (e.g. multiple files selected from the system upload dialog, or multiple
  files dropped in to the composer). Files will be sent in buckets to the handlers
  they match.
